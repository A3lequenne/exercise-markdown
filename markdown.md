## What is markdown ?
Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax designed to be converted to HTML and other formats using a tool of the same name. 

## Why use markdown ?
Because it's :
1. EASY: The syntax is so simple that you can learn in a minute or two, then write without finding anything weird or geeky.
2. FAST: It saves time compared to other file types/text formats. It helps speed up productivity and the writer's workflow.
3. CLEAN: Syntax and rendering are both clear, easy on the eyes and simple to manage.
4. FLEXIBLE: With a little configuration, your text will be translated on all platforms, editable in any editing software and convertible into a wide choice of formats.

## Markdown syntax
To format your text you can use the toolbar above the text area, or you can use markdown syntax.
* Text styles :
    * You can use `_` or `*` around a word to italicize it. Use two to make it bold.
* Code blocks :
    * Create a block of code by indenting each line with four spaces, or by putting three grave accents on the line above and below your code. Example:
        ` ```bloc of code``` `
        ```javaScript
        function sayHello(){
            alert("Hello")
        }
        ```
